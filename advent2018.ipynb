    "Hey there! For this year of Advent of Code, I'm going to be trying to journal my progress through the month's problems using a Python notebook, inspired by the similar notebooks of [Peter Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes). I've considered doing other things this year, like perhaps using the Advent of Code as an excuse to learn a new language, but last year I only completed the first 8, so I figured I should focus on first trying to complete all of this year's problems before getting ahead of myself. (Plus, the easier challenges make for good interview problem practice, so it fits in with my current goals).\n",

I used regular expressions again this time, but instead of splitting the string, I just used re.match while specifying groups in my pattern (using parentheses) so I could extract individual groups into tuples. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the most efficient method, but it's fairly readable and understandable, so I think it works fine. Since the time stamps of each string are fixed in size, it now occurs to me that I could probably have just picked slices out of the strings for the times, but I would still have to search for the guard IDs on the \"begins shift\" records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the calculation itself was fairly simple. Once I extracted the data into tuples (ordered by month, day, hour, minute), sorting in Python automatically places all of the records in the right order. Then I stored individual data for guards using a dictionary, associating an array of 60 integers for each guard. Once I determined the time interval during which a guard was sleeping, I simply incremented the corresponding entries of the array. It's possible this could be handled more efficiently somehow (perhaps with some variant of range queries?) but for a list of size 60, we can sleep safely at night. After we have the sleeping data for each guard, calculating the most-slept minutes (and the total time they spent sleeping) was easy."

    "This problem certainly off the bat seemed like a large difficulty spike compared to the previous puzzles. The problem was additionally challenging since I originally went down some incorrect paths, after intuitively thinking about the problem initially in terms of euclidaen distance, even though it actually specifies Manhattan distance to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, to start off this puzzle I began trying to think of how I could identify which points had areas that were finite. After some thinking (initially with the assumption of using Euclidean distance), I first realized that any point with finite area must be in some way \"enclosed\" by a polygon formed by other points, and moreover, there has to be a triangle of other points that enclose it. So if for each point I iterated over all triples of other points, and if I could easily calculate if one point was within a triangle of other points, then I could determine which points have bounded areas. (Calculating this is not trivial, but I found a StackOverfloow post offering an easy calculation for if a point is within a 2D triangle, and willingly borrowed it for my educational use).\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, after realizing I had to use Manhattan distance, I had to reconsider this \"finite area\" identification subproblem, as the triangle-based solution no longer worked. One thing I noticed was that the diagrams formed by the points were very clearly Voronoi diagrams, as like the one shown in [this picture](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Manhattan_Voronoi_Diagram.svg). After enough studying of the picture, I concluded for a point to have finite area, then when considering the four diagonal quadrants surrounding the point (that is, visualized like the cartesian quadrants but at a 45 degree angle), there must be at least one point in each of the quadrants, assuming we label each point as the center of its four quadrants. So in a similar fashion as with the triangle idea, I iterated through all 4-combinations of points, and checked which would satisfy this four-quadrant constraint. (The exact checking method can be seen in the `point_in_diamond` function). Fortunately, as the input given only includes 50 points, 50^4 is just small enough number of iterations to be practical to handle all the combinations. Now, we have identified which of the 50 points will have finite areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also after inspecting the input, I noticed that all 50 of the input points were within roughly a 400x400 grid space. This makes for about 160,000 individual \"locations\" on the grid, for which it would not be that expensive to calculate which input point each location is closest to. From here, it's just a matter of summing the number of locations associated with each input point, filtering out the input points with infinite space, and taking the maximum out of all of them to get the answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second star, the solution was easier as it just involve checking which points were within the constrained distance. Naturally, I just iterated over all of the locations, added the distance to each of the given points, and checked whether each was within the required constraint.\n",

    "Overall the code I wrote takes a while to run - around 30 seconds to a minute it seems, so I reckon there are probably some much more efficient algorithms for the problem. But I really enjoyed this challenge as a whole!"
