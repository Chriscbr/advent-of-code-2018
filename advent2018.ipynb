    "Hey there! For this year of Advent of Code, I'm going to be trying to journal my progress through the month's problems using a Python notebook, inspired by the similar notebooks of [Peter Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes). I've considered doing other things this year, like perhaps using the Advent of Code as an excuse to learn a new language, but last year I only completed the first 8, so I figured I should focus on first trying to complete all of this year's problems before getting ahead of myself. (Plus, the easier challenges make for good interview problem practice, so it fits in with my current goals).\n",

    "Since I'm very comfortable with Python, I'm going to try to be competitive with timing (as the time to write code is the main bottleneck typically - not the program execution), so I will try to finish on the leaderboard. But this is my first time using an Python notebook, so there's a chance this will slow me down. Better hope for the best!"

I ended up solving this puzzle using a simple brute force approach, storing all of the positions in a grid and then performing the necessary operations to update the grid with appropriate ownership of the squares.

    "As with Day 3, I was slowed down a bit by first figuring out what the most efficient way to parse the data was. I used regular expressions again this time, but instead of splitting the string, I just used re.match while specifying groups in my pattern (using parentheses) so I could extract individual groups into tuples. I'm not sure if this is necessarily the most efficient method, but it's fairly readable and understandable, so I think it works fine. Since the time stamps of each string are fixed in size, it now occurs to me that I could probably have just picked slices out of the strings for the times, but I would still have to search for the guard IDs on the \"begins shift\" records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the calculation itself was fairly simple. Once I extracted the data into tuples (ordered by month, day, hour, minute), sorting in Python automatically places all of the records in the right order. Then I stored individual data for guards using a dictionary, associating an array of 60 integers for each guard. Once I determined the time interval during which a guard was sleeping, I simply incremented the corresponding entries of the array. It's possible this could be handled more efficiently somehow (perhaps with some variant of range queries?) but for a list of size 60, we can sleep safely at night. After we have the sleeping data for each guard, calculating the most-slept minutes (and the total time they spent sleeping) was easy."
